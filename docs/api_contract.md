# API Contract

This document defines the interface between the Backend (FastAPI) and the Frontend (Vue 3).

## 0. Security & CORS
The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the following origins:
- `http://localhost:5173` (Vite Default)
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/rules`
- **Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "high_frequency_threshold": 10,
  "path_scanning_404_threshold": 5,
  "sensitive_paths": ["/.env", "/admin"],
  "suspicious_user_agents": ["sqlmap", "nikto"],
  "source": "/config/rules.yaml"
}
```

## 1. Health Check
Check if the API service is running.

- **Endpoint:** `GET /healthz`
- **Response:** `{"status": "ok"}`

## 2. Analyze Log
Analyzes Nginx log content via file upload and returns structured findings and aggregated incidents.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/analyze`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Accepted Extensions:** `.log`, `.txt`
- **Max File Size:** 5MB
- **Form Parameters:**
    - `file`: The log file to be analyzed.
    - `log_format`: (Optional) `auto`, `nginx`, or `apache`. Default is `auto`.
- **Configuration:** Detection rules can be customized via the `RULES_FILE` environment variable on the server side (pointing to a YAML file).

## 3. Analyze Logs as One Case (Batch)
Analyzes multiple uploaded log files as one combined case while preserving per-file parsing quality.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/analyze/batch`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Accepted Extensions:** `.log`, `.txt`
- **Max File Size:** 5MB per file
- **Max File Count:** 10 files
- **Form Parameters:**
    - `files`: One or more uploaded files using the same `files` field name.
    - `log_format`: (Optional) `auto`, `nginx`, or `apache`. Default is `auto`.
- **Validation Rules:**
    - At least one file is required.
    - Empty files return `400 Bad Request`.
    - More than 10 files returns `400 Bad Request`.
- **Response Notes:**
    - `analysis_mode` is set to `batch`.
    - `source_files` contains per-source parsing details for each uploaded file.
    - The top-level `parse_stats` field contains aggregate parsing quality across the whole batch case.

### Success Response Additions

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Analyze Log (Sanitized)
Analyzes Nginx log content via file upload and returns a sanitized result (IPs and secrets redacted).

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/analyze/sanitized`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Accepted Extensions:** `.log`, `.txt`
- **Max File Size:** 5MB
- **Response Structure:** Identical to `/api/analyze`, but content is redacted.

## 5. Analyze Log (Tuned)
