# Local Demo Guide

Follow these steps to demonstrate the **AI Log Security Analyzer** on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+

## Step 1: Start the Backend (FastAPI)
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You can view the API documentation at [/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## Step 2: Start the Frontend (Vue 3)
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Alternative: Using Docker Compose
If you prefer Docker, you can start both the backend and frontend with a single command:

1. In the project root directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
2. Once the containers are running, access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
3. To stop the services, run `docker compose down`.

## Step 3: 5-Minute Demo Script (Release v1.7 Ready)

1. **Launch with Docker**:
   - Run `docker compose up --build`.
   - Open `http://localhost:5173`.
2. **Language Switch (v1.7.1)**:
   - Notice the **"中文 | English"** toggle in the header.
   - Click **"English"** to switch the UI to English.
   - Click **"中文"** to switch back to Chinese.
   - Observe that the preference is preserved after a page refresh.
3. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Click **"Choose a .log or .txt file"**.
   - Select `samples/nginx_access_sample.log`.
   - Click **"Analyze"**.
   - Review results and notice the entry in **Recent Analyses**.
3. **Compare Analysis (v1.7)**:
   - Upload the same file again or another sample (e.g., `samples/apache_access_sample.log`).
   - Scroll to the **Report Comparison** section.
   - Select the first analysis as **Baseline** and the second as **Target**.
   - Click **"开始对比 (Start Comparison)"**.
   - Review the **Risk Score Delta** and **Severity Changes**.
   - Observe the **Finding/Incident Changes** (Added/Removed).
   - Click **"下载对比报告 (Download Comparison MD)"**.
4. **Review Executive Summary (v1.6)**:
   - Notice the **Executive Summary** card at the top.
   - Point out the **Risk Score (0-100)** and **Risk Level** (e.g., Critical/High).
   - Highlight that this summary is **deterministic and rule-based** (No LLM/External API).
   - Click **"Download MD"** to save the executive summary separately.
4. **Review Metrics & Quality**:
   - Check **Parse Stats**: Notice the 90%+ success rate.
   - Expand **Skipped Line Samples**: See the malformed line identified by the parser.
4. **Prioritize Risks**:
   - Check **Severity Distribution**: See the High/Medium/Low counts for Incidents.
5. **Investigate Timeline**:
   - Scroll to **Attack Timeline**.
   - Filter by **Severity: HIGH**.
   - Expand **Evidence** for a "Directory Scanning" event to see the exact URI.
6. **Deep Dive Findings**:
   - Scroll to **Security Findings**.
   - Search for `sqlmap` in the search box.
   - Expand **Matched Details** to see the specific counts and values.
7. **Analyst Export**:
   - Filter Findings by **Severity: MEDIUM**.
   - Click **"Download CSV"** to export the filtered list.
   - Click **"Download Summary (.json)"** for the metrics-only export.
8. **Sanitized Sharing**:
   - Scroll to the **Markdown Report** section.
   - Click **"Download Sanitized (.md)"**.
   - Verify (manually) that IPs are masked and sensitive paths are redacted.

## Step 4: Perform Analysis (Manual Steps)
1. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. **Check Active Rules**: Before uploading, look at the **"Active Rule Configuration"** section. It shows the current thresholds and sensitive patterns being used for detection.
3. Click the **"Choose a .log or .txt file"** button.
3. Select the provided sample file: `samples/nginx_access_sample.log` or `samples/apache_access_sample.log`.
    *   **Note**: `samples/nginx_access_sample.log` deliberately contains one malformed line to demonstrate how the tool handles and reports skipped lines.
4. (Optional) Select the **Log Format** (Auto Detect works for both).
5. Click the **"Analyze"** button.

## Step 4: Explore Results
- **Overview Statistics**: View total requests, unique IPs, and error counts.
- **Severity Distribution**: Check the **"Severity Distribution"** cards to see the breakdown of High, Medium, and Low risks for both individual Findings and aggregated Incidents. This helps you quickly prioritize your response.
- **Attack Timeline View**: Explore the **"Attack Timeline"** section to see a chronological narrative of the security events. 
    - Use the **Severity Filter** to focus on critical steps in the attack.
    - Search for a specific **Source IP** to trace the movement of a particular attacker over time.
    - Expand the **Evidence** snippets to see the exact log line that triggered each event.
- **Parsing Quality**: Check the **"Parsing Quality"** card to see the success rate of the log parser. If some lines are skipped, it might indicate an incompatible log format. You can see **Skipped Line Samples** (up to 5) with their original line numbers and content to help you troubleshoot the log format or identify corrupt log entries.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Check Top 5 IPs and Paths.
- **Security Findings**: Review identified risks like "Sensitive Path Probing" or "Suspicious User Agent". Each card shows a description, recommendation, and evidence.
- **Rule Match Details**: In the **"Security Findings"** section, notice that each card now includes a **"Matched Details"** area. This shows the total number of rule matches (`Count`), which fields were used for matching (`Fields`), and a list of specific values (`Values`). For findings with many matched values (e.g., multiple sensitive paths), click **"Show all matched values"** to see the full list or **"Show less"** to collapse.
- **Markdown Report**: Scroll to the bottom to see the full Markdown report. Each finding in the report also includes its structured "Matched Details".
- **Download**: Click **"Download Report (.md)"** to save the analysis locally as5. Click the **"Analyze"** button.

## Step 5: Recent Analyses
The tool automatically remembers your recent work:
1. After performing an analysis, notice the **"Recent Analyses"** section above the statistics.
2. It shows the file name, time, and key metrics (parse rate, incidents, etc.).
3. Refresh the page or close your browser.
4. Open the tool again—the history is still there (stored in your browser's `localStorage`).
5. Click on a history item to instantly restore the analysis results without re-uploading the file.
6. Click **"Clear History"** to remove all local records.

## Step 6: Filter and Search
When dealing with many findings, use the built-in filters:
1.  Scroll to **"Aggregated Security Incidents"**.
2.  Use the **Severity** dropdown to show only "HIGH" risks.
3.  Type an IP address in the **Source IP** box to focus on a specific attacker.
4.  Scroll to **"Security Findings"**.
5. Try the **Search** box to find specific keywords (e.g., "sqlmap" or ".env").
6. Filter by **Rule** to see all instances of a specific detection rule.
7. **Analyst Workflow - Exporting**:
    - After filtering, notice the **"Download JSON"** and **"Download CSV"** buttons.
    - Click **"Download CSV"** for a filtered list of High-severity incidents. You can open this file in Excel or Google Sheets for further tracking.
    - Notice the **security warning** badge: "Raw JSON/CSV exports may contain sensitive log evidence. Review before sharing."
8. Click **"Copy Filtered JSON"** to quickly export the current view to your clipboard for use in other tools.
9. Look for an incident or finding with many evidence samples. Click **"Show all evidence"** to expand the full list and **"Show less"** to collapse it back.
10. Scroll to the **Markdown Report** section and click **"Download Summary (.json)"**. This provides a machine-readable summary of the entire analysis (metrics only, no raw logs).
11. Click **"Clear"** or **"Clear Filters"** to reset.

## Step 7: Safe Sharing with Sanitization
One of the key features of the analyzer is the ability to share results without leaking sensitive data.
1. In the Markdown Report section, look for the **"Download Sanitized (.md)"** button.
2. Click it to generate a redacted version of the report.
3. **What's the difference?**
   - **Raw Report**: Contains full IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.105`) and original query parameters. This is for internal investigation.
   - **Sanitized Report**: Redacts IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) and hides sensitive parameters like `token`, `password`, or `session`. This is for sharing with external teams or community forums while protecting infrastructure privacy.

## Step 8: History & Cached Sanitization
1. Perform a new analysis and click **Download Sanitized (.md)**.
2. Notice the record in **"Recent Analyses"** now has a **"Sanitized cached"** tag.
3. Refresh the page and select this record from history.
4. You can still download the Sanitized Report even though the original file isn't uploaded, because the result was cached in your browser's storage.
5. If you select a history record *without* the cache and without re-uploading the file, the button will be disabled with a helpful tip.

## Step 9: Clear Current vs. Clear History
1. Perform an analysis or select a record from history.
2. Click the **"Clear Current Result"** button near the top.
3. Observe that the analysis results disappear and the page returns to its initial state.
4. Notice that the **"Recent Analyses"** list still contains all your previous records.
5. Select a record from history again to restore it.
6. Now click **"Clear History"** inside the Recent Analyses section.
7. Observe that all historical records are now removed from the browser's storage.

## 3-Minute Demo Script

Use this script for a quick and effective demonstration of the project.

1.  **Project Introduction (30s)**:
    *   "This is AI Log Security Analyzer, a local-first tool for Nginx log analysis."
    *   "It goes beyond simple parsing by aggregating low-level findings into high-level security incidents."
    *   "Everything runs locally—your logs never leave your machine."

2.  **Upload & Analysis (30s)**:
    *   Open the Web UI.
    *   Drag and drop `samples/nginx_access_sample.log`.
    *   Click "Analyze" and highlight the speed of processing.

3.  **Insight Walkthrough (1m)**:
    *   **Incidents**: Show how multiple probes from one IP are grouped into a single "Advanced Reconnaissance Activity" incident.
    *   **Findings**: Scroll down to show individual findings with specific evidence and recommendations.
    *   **Evidence**: Point out the raw log snippets attached to each finding to show transparency.

4.  **Reporting & Sharing (1m)**:
    *   Show the Markdown preview at the bottom.
    *   Download the **Raw Report** for internal records.
    *   Explain the privacy risk of sharing raw logs, then click **Download Sanitized**.
    *   Show the sanitized report to demonstrate how IPs and tokens are automatically masked.

5. **Bonus: Docker Deployment (Optional)**:
    *   Mention that the entire stack can be launched with `docker compose up --build` for consistent environment setup.

## Customizing Rules (rules.yaml)

You can demonstrate how to change detection thresholds without changing code:

1.  Open `config/rules.yaml`.
2.  Change `high_frequency_threshold` from `10` to `2`.
3.  Run the CLI again:
    ```bash
    python -m app.cli ../samples/nginx_access_sample.log --rules ../config/rules.yaml
    ```
4.  Observe that more IPs are now flagged for "High Frequency Request" in the summary.
